# Restaurant Reviews Web App
This web app is the final project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree
program. See the original repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1/tree/google-maps).
_**Note**_ that this is the Google Maps branch.

## Developer Set Up
First, copy the app's files to your local environment by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithOz/RestaurantReviewsApp.git
```
from the command line. Alternatively, you can download the zip files
and unzip them into your chosen destination folder. If you are new to
git, visit its [official website](https://git-scm.com/) for more information.

Next, we must install the dependencies. Open your terminal program
and run
```
npm install
```
followed by
```
bower install
```
If you use a Unix system, the above commands can be condensed into
```
npm install && bower install
```
On Windows systems running PowerShell, the [correct condensed form](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41816341/7987987) is
```
npm install; if ($?) { bower install }
```
If you are new to package management, read more about [npm](npmjs.com) and
[bower](https://bower.io/).
